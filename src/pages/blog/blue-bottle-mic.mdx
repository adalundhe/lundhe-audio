        Blue (Baltic Latvian Universal Electronics) is one of the most legendary microphone manufacturers
        on the planet. Although now primarily known for the Yeti desktop condenser mic, Blue's original
        claim to fame was as a prolific designer and manufacturer of high-end professional microphones and preamps
        used in countless recordings during the '90s and '00s.

        <Paragraph styles="w-1/2 self-center ml-2" align='left'>
            Of these modern classics, the hulking Bottle valve condenser microphone was the crown jewel. Featuring
            Blue's yet-to-be-replicated modular "bottle cap" capsule system and built using premium components, the Bottle
            was manufacturered primarily during the '00s and '10s, being silently discontinued at some point between 
            2017-2020 after Logitech acquired the brand.
        </Paragraph>
    </div>
    <Paragraph>
        The Bottle never achieved the same level of popularity as
        many of its contemporaries - mostly due to an eyewatering MSRP of $4000 USD (in '00s dollars at that) - 
        albeit this included three of the initial set of nine capsules that were released with the mic. 
        Combined with the additional cost of about $700 USD per bottle cap, and owning even just the 
        initial set of nine capsules easily drove the total cost upwards of $8000 USD!
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
        Since its quiet discontinuance, newer microphones have attempted to replicate the Bottle's utility, albeit none with the same versatility
        and style. The Bottle enjoys a healthy demand on the used market, with used prices ranging from $3000 USD for the main body
        and a single capsule to upwards of $10k for a full capsule kit. This continues to make it a expensive statement piece for most
        studios - especially if that studio owns either the original capsule set of nine bottle caps or expanded capsule set of twelve. While 
        not as fashionable as older, vintage Neumann or Telefunken microphones, the Bottle is both beautiful and imposing - larger than your forearm
        and <i>significantly</i> heavier than almost any other microphone produced.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
        The Bottle and its capsules also remain repairable thanks to the expertise of of ex-Blue staff, including Andrew Monheim of
        <BlogLink to="https://monheimmicrophones.com/">Monheim Microphones</BlogLink> and ex-Blue cofounder Juris Zarins of 
        <BlogLink to="https://usashop.jzmic.com/">JZ Microphones</BlogLink>. The original set of nine capsules can easily be found on the used market
        for $500 USD - $600 USD a piece, so failing or aging bottle caps can readily be replaced. The extended capsule set - i.e. the

        <BlogLink to="https://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/BottleCapB9--blue-microphones-bottle-cap-11">B11</BlogLink> bottle caps - are 
        practically unobtanium, usually only showing up as parts of (very expensive) used complete capsule sets.

                    The Blue B0 Bottle Cap is Blue's take on the legendary
                    <BlogLink to="https://recordinghacks.com/microphones/Telefunken/ElaM-251">Telefunken ELA M 251</BlogLink>,
                    arguably one-of-if-not-the most popular vocal microphones of all time. It has a "silky" and "detailed" sound
                    that makes it ideal for capturing the nuances of vocalists and acoustic instrumentation.

                    <b>What's the Use Case?</b>
                </div>
                <div>
                    The B0 manages to achieve the ELA M 251's sparkling top without sounding harsh. For that reason alone, we love
                    to use it on vocalists at Lündhé Audio. We also often use it on acoustic strummed instruments or percussion, where 
                    its presence gives transients a natural clarity.
                    <br/>
                    Since its debut, the B0 capsule remains one of the better sounding ELA M 251 inspired capsules - it lacks the sputtery
                    sizzle plagues cheaper clones while having reduced noise when compared to vintage 251s. Telefunken has since reissued the
                    ELA M 251 as the 251E, and while that reissue is stellar - we personally find Blue's interpretation equally convincing.
                    <br/>
                    Unfortunately, unlike a real 251 (or its reissue), the B0 bottle cap is cardiod-only.

                    The Blue B1 Bottle Cap is based off of the Schoeps 221B and is a small diaphragm cardiod condenser capsule. The B1
                    focuses on clarity and precision - coloring the sound little if at all.

                <div>
                    The B1 is ideal for recording delicate, nuanced sources such as acoustic guitars, strings, or acoustic percussion. At Lündhé Audio,
                    we often utilize the B1 for close-micing sources or for acoustic-instrument based sampling, as its speed and transparency are unrivaled.
                    The cardiod pattern <i>does</i> mean a more "focused" sound than the 
                    <BlogLink to="#blue-b4-cap" linkType='internal'>B4 bottle cap</BlogLink>, but that focus also allows sounds 
                    it picks up to cut through any mix with a natural ease. 
                    <br/>
                    For those looking to "try out" the B1 Bottle Cap without committing to a full Blue Bottle microphone setup, the superb
                    <BlogLink to="https://www.soundonsound.com/reviews/blue-hummingbird">Blue Hummingbird</BlogLink> can be found used for often
                    less that $200 USD and has a unique swivel-head that allows for far more flexible placemen than the massive Blue Bottle. In fact,
                    we like the B1 Bottle Cap and Hummingbird Microphone so much at Lündhé Audio that we have three!

                    The Blue B2 Bottle Cap is the dark horse of the Blue bottle cap family, based on the famous
                    <BlogLink to="https://vintageking.com/rca-44-a?srsltid=AfmBOororqOIeYXZzlLmoY-jtKmsrIiMawehjRppWDXq5kt9PMZBe72C">RCA 44 Ribbon Microphone</BlogLink>.
                    The capsule is a figure-eight pattern and shares the velvety, rich sound of classic ribbon microphones (without the 
                    worries of damaging the ribbon).
                </div>

                    <b>What's the Use Case?</b>
                </div>
                <div >
                    The B2 is a challeing capsule in that it's effectively a condenser microphone capsule voiced to act 
                    like a classic ribbon microphone. It brings aspects of each of these types of microphones, which makes it unique
                    but also endows it with the steepest learning curve of any of Blue's bottle caps.
                    <br/>
                    At first, you'll be tempted to use the B2 bottle cap either as a condenser or drop-in ribbon replacement. This will
                    lead to some frustration, as the B2 bottle cap is simultaneously both of these things and neither of them. At 
                    Lündhé Audio, we've personally encountered the greatest success when utilizing the B2 bottle cap as a room mic or 
                    on guitar cabs. Using it to mic up acoustic stringed instruments can lead to muddy sound.
                    <br/>
                    We've likewise had great success with the B2 bottle cap as a kick mic, where its decidedly vintage sound is greate at mellowing
                    out the snap of modern kick drums.
