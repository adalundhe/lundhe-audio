        Blue (Baltic Latvian Universal Electronics) is one of the most legendary microphone manufacturers
        on the planet. Although now primarily known for the Yeti desktop condenser mic, Blue's original
        claim to fame was as a prolific designer and manufacturer of high-end professional microphones and preamps
        used in countless recordings during the '90s and '00s.

            Of these modern classics, the hulking Bottle valve condenser microphone was the crown jewel. Featuring
            Blue's yet-to-be-replicated modular "bottle cap" capsule system and built using premium components, the Bottle
            was manufacturered primarily during the '00s and '10s, being silently discontinued at some point between 
            2017-2020 after Logitech acquired the brand.

    <Paragraph>
        The Bottle never achieved the same level of popularity as
        many of its contemporaries - mostly due to an eyewatering MSRP of $4000 USD (in '00s dollars at that) - 
        albeit this included three of the initial set of nine capsules that were released with the mic. 
        Combined with the additional cost of about $700 USD per bottle cap, and owning even just the 
        initial set of nine capsules easily drove the total cost upwards of $8000 USD!
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
        Since its quiet discontinuance, newer microphones have attempted to replicate the Bottle's utility, albeit none with the same versatility
        and style. The Bottle enjoys a healthy demand on the used market, with used prices ranging from $3000 USD for the main body
        and a single capsule to upwards of $10k for a full capsule kit. This continues to make it a expensive statement piece for most
        studios - especially if that studio owns either the original capsule set of nine bottle caps or expanded capsule set of twelve. While 
        not as fashionable as older, vintage Neumann or Telefunken microphones, the Bottle is both beautiful and imposing - larger than your forearm
        and <i>significantly</i> heavier than almost any other microphone produced.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
        The Bottle and its capsules also remain repairable thanks to the expertise of of ex-Blue staff, including Andrew Monheim of
        <BlogLink to="https://monheimmicrophones.com/">Monheim Microphones</BlogLink> and ex-Blue cofounder Juris Zarins of 
        <BlogLink to="https://usashop.jzmic.com/">JZ Microphones</BlogLink>. The original set of nine capsules can easily be found on the used market
        for $500 USD - $600 USD a piece, so failing or aging bottle caps can readily be replaced. The extended capsule set - i.e. the

        <BlogLink to="https://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/BottleCapB9--blue-microphones-bottle-cap-11">B11</BlogLink> bottle caps - are 
        practically unobtanium, usually only showing up as parts of (very expensive) used complete capsule sets.

        Each Bottle Cap is its own unique entity with its own character and utility. Where possible, we'll do our best to cite which
        famous microphones used as the basis for each capsule.

            </div>
            <div className='pb-4'>
                The Blue B1 Bottle Cap is based off of the Schoeps 221B and is a small diaphragm cardiod condenser capsule. The B1
                focuses on clarity and precision - coloring the sound little if at all.

                <b>What's the Use Case?</b>
            </div>
            <div className='pb-4'>
                The B1 is ideal for recording delicate, nuanced sources such as acoustic guitars, strings, or acoustic percussion. At Lündhé Audio,
                we often utilize the B1 for close-micing sources or for acoustic-instrument based sampling, as its speed and transparency are unrivaled.
