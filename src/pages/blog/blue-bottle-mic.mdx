    <Paragraph>
        Blue (Baltic Latvian Universal Electronics) is one of the most legendary microphone manufacturers
        on the planet. Although now primarily known for the Yeti desktop condenser mic, Blue's original
        claim to fame was as a prolific designer and manufacturer of high-end professional microphones and preamps
        used in countless recordings during the '90s and '00s.

                Of these modern classics, the hulking Bottle valve condenser microphone was the crown jewel. Featuring
                Blue's yet-to-be-replicated modular "bottle cap" capsule system and built using premium components, the Bottle
                was manufacturered primarily during the '00s and '10s, being silently discontinued at some point between 
                2017-2020 after Logitech acquired the brand.
            </Paragraph>}
    />
    <Paragraph>
        The Bottle never achieved the same level of popularity as
        many of its contemporaries - mostly due to an eyewatering MSRP of $4000 USD (in '00s dollars at that) - 
        albeit this included three of the initial set of nine capsules that were released with the mic. 
        Combined with the additional cost of about $700 USD per bottle cap, and owning even just the 
        initial set of nine capsules easily drove the total cost upwards of $8000 USD!
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
        Since its quiet discontinuance, newer microphones have attempted to replicate the Bottle's utility, albeit none with the same versatility
        and style. The Bottle enjoys a healthy demand on the used market, with used prices ranging from $3000 USD for the main body
        and a single capsule to upwards of $10k for a full capsule kit. This continues to make it a expensive statement piece for most
        studios - especially if that studio owns either the original capsule set of nine bottle caps or expanded capsule set of twelve. While 
        not as fashionable as older, vintage Neumann or Telefunken microphones, the Bottle is both beautiful and imposing - larger than your forearm
        and <i>significantly</i> heavier than almost any other microphone produced.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
        The Bottle and its capsules also remain repairable thanks to the expertise of of ex-Blue staff, including Andrew Monheim of
        <BlogLink to="https://monheimmicrophones.com/">Monheim Microphones</BlogLink> and ex-Blue cofounder Juris Zarins of 
        <BlogLink to="https://usashop.jzmic.com/">JZ Microphones</BlogLink>. The original set of nine capsules can easily be found on the used market
        for $500 USD - $600 USD a piece, so failing or aging bottle caps can readily be replaced. The extended capsule set - i.e. the

        <BlogLink to="https://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/BottleCapB9--blue-microphones-bottle-cap-11">B11</BlogLink> bottle caps - are 
        practically unobtanium, usually only showing up as parts of (very expensive) used complete capsule sets.

            <b>Overview</b>
        </div>
        <div>
            The Blue B0 Bottle Cap is Blue's take on the legendary
            <BlogLink to="https://recordinghacks.com/microphones/Telefunken/ElaM-251">Telefunken ELA M 251</BlogLink>,
            arguably one-of-if-not-the most popular vocal microphones of all time. It has a "silky" and "detailed" sound
            that makes it ideal for capturing the nuances of vocalists and acoustic instrumentation.
        </div>
        <div className='text-[1.5vmax]'>
            <b>What's the Use Case?</b>
        </div>
        <div>
            The B0 manages to achieve the ELA M 251's sparkling top without sounding harsh. For that reason alone, we love
            to use it on vocalists at Lündhé Audio. We also often use it on acoustic strummed instruments or percussion, where 
            its presence gives transients a natural clarity.
            <br/>
            Since its debut, the B0 capsule remains one of the better sounding ELA M 251 inspired capsules - it lacks the sputtery
            sizzle plagues cheaper clones while having reduced noise when compared to vintage 251s. Telefunken has since reissued the
            ELA M 251 as the 251E, and while that reissue is stellar - we personally find Blue's interpretation equally convincing.
            <br/>
            Unfortunately, unlike a real 251 (or its reissue), the B0 bottle cap is cardiod-only.

        <div>
            The Blue B1 Bottle Cap is based off of the <BlogLink to="recordinghacks.com/microphones/Schoeps/M-221-B">Schoeps 221B</BlogLink> and is a small diaphragm cardiod condenser capsule. The B1
            focuses on clarity and precision - coloring the sound little if at all.
        </div>
        <div className='text-[1.5vmax]'>
            <b>What's the Use Case?</b>
        </div>
        <div>
            The B1 is ideal for recording delicate, nuanced sources such as acoustic guitars, strings, or acoustic percussion. At Lündhé Audio,
            we often utilize the B1 for close-micing sources or for acoustic-instrument based sampling, as its speed and transparency are unrivaled.
            The cardiod pattern <i>does</i> mean a more "focused" sound than the 
            <BlogLink to="#blue-b4-cap" linkType='internal'>B4 bottle cap</BlogLink>, but that focus also allows sounds 
            it picks up to cut through any mix with a natural ease. 
            <br/>
            For those looking to "try out" the B1 Bottle Cap without committing to a full Blue Bottle microphone setup, the superb
            <BlogLink to="https://www.soundonsound.com/reviews/blue-hummingbird">Blue Hummingbird</BlogLink> can be found used for often
            less that $200 USD and has a unique swivel-head that allows for far more flexible placemen than the massive Blue Bottle. In fact,
            we like the B1 Bottle Cap and Hummingbird Microphone so much at Lündhé Audio that we have three!

            The Blue B2 Bottle Cap is the dark horse of the Blue bottle cap family, based on the famous
            <BlogLink to="https://vintageking.com/rca-44-a?srsltid=AfmBOororqOIeYXZzlLmoY-jtKmsrIiMawehjRppWDXq5kt9PMZBe72C">RCA 44 Ribbon Microphone</BlogLink>.
            The capsule is a figure-eight pattern and shares the velvety, rich sound of classic ribbon microphones (without the 
            worries of damaging the ribbon).
        </div>
        <div className='text-[1.5vmax]'>
            <b>What's the Use Case?</b>
        </div>
        <div >
            The B2 is a challeing capsule in that it's effectively a condenser microphone capsule voiced to act 
            like a classic ribbon microphone. It brings aspects of each of these types of microphones, which makes it unique
            but also endows it with the steepest learning curve of any of Blue's bottle caps.
            <br/>
            At first, you'll be tempted to use the B2 bottle cap either as a condenser or drop-in ribbon replacement. This will
            lead to some frustration, as the B2 bottle cap is simultaneously both of these things and neither of them. At 
            Lündhé Audio, we've personally encountered the greatest success when utilizing the B2 bottle cap as a room mic or 
            on guitar cabs. Using it to mic up acoustic stringed instruments can lead to muddy sound.
            <br/>
            We've likewise had great success with the B2 bottle cap as a kick mic, where its decidedly vintage sound is greate at mellowing
            out the snap of modern kick drums.

            <b>What's the Use Case?</b>

        <div>
            The B3 is shockingly transparent for a Blue microphone capsule. While it's often tempting to go for
            more "exciting" options like the <BlogLink to="#blue-b0-cap" linkType="internal">B0 capsule</BlogLink> or 
            <BlogLink to="#blue-b10-cap" linkType="internal">B10 capsule</BlogLink>, the B3 bottle cap offers a clean, clear, honest
            capture that ensures later processing can work to the best of its ability.
            <br/>
            At Lündhé Audio, we often use the B3 capsule to record acousting instruments and foley material. The B3 capsule simply
            stays out of the way, letting us work with recorded material unimpeded.

            The B4 Bottle Cap is the second small diaphragm offering in Blue's lineup. Based off the 
            <BlogLink to ="https://recordinghacks.com/microphones/neumann/m-50">Neumann M50</BlogLink>, the B4 bottle cap has an 
            omnidirectional pickup pattern and lush, sweet sound.

            <b>What's the Use Case?</b>
        </div>
        <div>
            The B4 is one of the most in-demand capsules on the used market, and for good reason - it sounds
            utterly fantastic in almost any recording situation. The B4 bottle cap turns the Bottle into a first-class 
            room mic, and easily stands shoulders with titans like Schoeps or DPA in its ability to capture the sound 
            of the space its in.
            <br/>
            Unlike some small-diaphragm omni options, the B4 is not clinical - the capsule <i>does</i> have a sound that
            slightly flatters like the best Schoeps mics do. Unlike its inspiration, a Blue Bottle with a B4 bottle cap 
            has low self-noise. This makes it even more ideal for recording orchestras or capturing similar performances 
            where nuance and detail matter.

            The Blue B5 Bottle Cap is based off of the <BlogLink to="https://recordinghacks.com/microphones/Neumann/CMV-563">M55K capsule 
            used in the Neumann CMV-563</BlogLink>, Neumann's first measurement microphone. The B5 bottle cap is an omnidirectional

            <b>What's the Use Case?</b>
        </div>
        <div>
            The B5's sound is summarily "larger than life" - emphasizing low and high frequency content. This can make the B5 bottle cap a
            bit of a specialist - its scooped sound is ideal for resuscitating dull instruments, adding additional attack <i>and</i> thump
            to percussive instrumentation that lacks authority, or making guitar amps sound wreckingly massive.
            <br/>
            At Lündhé Audio, we love using the B5 of any thing that needs a bit of extra "juice". The B5 bottle cap is a mainstay on our guitar
            cabinets for the massive sound it imparts, and we love to blend it in parallel with more neutral captures to add a bit of magic. It 
            pairs perfectly with the <BlogLink to="#blue-b2-cap" linkType="internal">B2 bottle cap</BlogLink>, where the B5's extended highs and 
            lows add presence and weight.

            The Blue B6 Bottle Cap is based off the legendary <BlogLink to="https://www.abbeyroad.com/news/abbey-road-microphone-collection-the-akg-c12-2906">
            AKG C12</BlogLink>, and is Blue's "reference standard". Most used Blue Bottle microphones will come with this capsule de-facto, and it is considered 
            to be one of the best in Blue's bottle cap range. The B6 bottle cap is edge-terminated and has a detailed, classic sound and has a cardiod pickup 
            pattern.

            <b>What's the Use Case?</b>
        </div>
        <div>
            The B6 accomplishes its goal of being an AKG C12 with absolute aplomb. The sound is detailed yet never harsh, warm but never boomy of muffled - the 
            B6 simply delivers excellent sound almost irrespective of the application, and with modern mivrophone benefits like low self-noise and better 
            reliability. This is 
            <br/>
            This capsule is a popular option at Lündhé Audio - to the point that we carry four of the capsules to ensure both of Blue's Bottle mics always
            have access to at least one. It's easier to list the things we don't tend to use the B6 on than those we do - ambient room capture for example -
            the capsule is simply that impressive. This also marksthe point in the Bottle Cap lineup where we start to enter the "classic" Blue capsule range.
            These are bottle caps that are vaunted for their sound and also readily available on used markets.

            The Blue B7 Bottle Cap is based off of classic <BlogLink to="https://blog.insideblackbird.com/the-neumann-u47-a-legend-in-the-world-of-microphones">Neumann U47</BlogLink>,
            arguable the most famous and popular microphone in the world (with Neumann it's always hard to choose). The B7 bottle cap has a more 
            relaxed and "vintage" sound, and has a cardiod pickup pattern.

        <div className='text-[1.5vmax]'>
            <b>What's the Use Case?</b>
        </div>
        <div>
            The B7 is the perfect foil to the <BlogLink to="#blue-b6-cap" linkType='internal'>B6 bottle cap</BlogLink>, with its focus on midrange
            and smooth highs. For siblant or naturally "bright" vocalists, the B7 bottle cap is thus a natural choice. Likewise, for those looking 
            to capture the sound of classic recordings, the B7 is probably the best option in Blue's bottle cap lineup.
            <br/>
            The B7 Bottle Cap is Lündhé Audio founder Ada Lündhé's favorite, offering a perfect balance of warm-yet-engaging. The capsule is also 
            center-terminated, offering increased dynamic resolution that allows the microphone to handle even the loudest sources. at Lündhé Audio,
            we tend to favor the B7 bottle cap on lead vocals, where its sonic signature tends to bring out the best in most any 
            performance.

        <div>
            The Blue B8 Bottle Cap is a design unique to Blue, focused on detailed but natural sound. Blue designed 
            the B8 capsule to be the "workhorse" of the Bottle Cap lineup, and it indeed serves as an excellent 
            all-rounder. The capsule has a slightly bright sound that helps it capture performance details that the 
            more neutral <BlogLink to="#blue-b3-cap" linkType='internal'>B3 bottle cap</BlogLink> might struggle with.
            The capsule has a cardoid pickup pattern.

        <div className='text-[1.5vmax]'>
            <b>What's the Use Case?</b>
        </div>
        <div>
            The B8 is Blue's generalist - a jack of all trades that should be in any Blue Bottle Cap microphone locker.
            The B8 does emphasize high-end content of recordings but is never harsh. The midrange is arguably as 
            netural as the <BlogLink to="#blue-b3-cap" linkType='internal'>B3 bottle cap</BlogLink>, but the additional
            detail information can be useful in reducing mix work down-the-line.
            <br/>
            At Lündhé Audio, we tend to utilize the B8 bottle cap on sounds that require a bit of additional intimacy or
            that need additional transient detail to cut through a mix. It's an excellent and often first-stop choice 
            for when we need to capture a source in a way where we know the recording will sound great, but our hands 
            won't be tied by the sonic signature of the capsule.

        <div>
            The Blue B9 Bottle Cap has the most extended high-end of any of Blue's bottle caps, with
            "liquid" mids that seem to bring out the best in vocal performances Although not officially
            acknowledged, it's generally understood the the B9 bottle cap is Blue's take on the inimitable

        <div className='text-[1.5vmax]'>
            <b>What's the Use Case?</b>
        </div>
        <div>
            The B9 is <i>bright</i>, even for a Blue microphone capsule. For this reason, it's often best
            suited to capturing the crisp ultra-modern vocal performance of modern pop, rap/hip-hop, and R&B.
            The B9 is absolutely unforgiving of siblant voices, and almost requires that the Blue be plugged in
            to a "vintage" sounding preamp to get the best results.
            <br/>
            This isn't to paint the B9 as a one-trick pony - it's equally at home at capturing other sources like 
            acousting guitars or similar plucked/hammer string instruments. Whatever the B9 bottle cap does capture 
            though will absolutely be at the front of the mix.
            <br/>
            We're also now entering the range of capsules that are "virtually unobtanium". Blue's
            <BlogLink to="blue-b9-cap" linkType="internal">B9</BlogLink>, <BlogLink to="blue-b10-cap" linkType="internal">B10</BlogLink>,
            and <BlogLink to="blue-b11-cap" linkType="internal">B11</BlogLink> capsules almost <i>never</i> appear 
            on the used market, and when they do it is often as part of a (very expensive) complete bottle cap set.

            <BlogLink to="https://www.recordingsessionvault.com/featured-gear-microphone">Neumann U67</BlogLink>.
            Like the U67, the B10 bottle cap has a warm, rich, smooth sound that harkens back to classic recordings.
            The B10 bottle cap has a cardiod pickup pattern.

        <div className='text-[1.5vmax]'>
            <b>What's the Use Case?</b>
        </div>
        <div>
            The B10 is an interesting foil to Blue's other "vintage voiced" capsule, the <BlogLink to="#blue-b7-cap">B7 
            bottle cap </BlogLink> - the lows sound more extended while the highs sound slightly more tamed. This makes 
            the B10 bottle cap ideal for recording siblant sources or vocalists looking for that classic touch. While the 
            B10 bottle cap certainly isn't "dark" sounding, it may struggle in capturing more complex material, where its 
            sultry sound may come across as muddy and wooly.
            <br/>
            At Lündhé Audio, the B10 bottle cap is almost exclusively relegated to vocal duties, where it's rich sound 
            delivers best.

        <div>
            The Blue B11 Bottle Cap is Blue's take on another classic - the venerable 
            <BlogLink to="https://germanmasterworks.com/publish/articles/GalleryOfGreats/Neumann-M49.html">Neumann M49</BlogLink>.
            Likethe M49, the B11 bottle cap has a "better than real life" sound - making captured 
            material sound like the best version of itself without overly emphasizing any particular
            frequency range. The B11 bottle cap has a cardiod pickup pattern.

            <b>What's the Use Case?</b>
        </div>
        <div>
            The B11 brings the best of vintage voicing to modern production - flattering sounds without compromising
            their fundamental tone or character. The highs of the B11 bottle cap are silky and smooth without being dark,
            the midrange sweet, and the lows extended and natural. The Blue B11 bottle cap simply makes and sound source it
            captures - vocal, guitar, percussion, orchestra, or anything else - sound better.
            <br/>
            This is Lündhé Audio founder Ada Lündhé's other favorite in the Blue lineup. Of the "unobtanium range" of 
            Blue capsules, the B11 bottle cap is (subjectively) the most worth pursuing. Its sound is simply unlike any 
            other capsule in the Blue bottle cap lineup and unlike any other microphone we've heard.

        Among the many high-quality microphones we offer at Lündhé Audio, our Blue Bottles are truly our favorite, offering unparalleled
        sound and versatility.
        <br/>
        We're fortunate to own not only multiples of the main 
        <BlogLink to="#blue-b0-cap" linkType="internal">B0</BlogLink>-<BlogLink to="#blue-b8-cap" linkType="internal">B8</BlogLink>
        bottle cap range but two entire Blue Bottle microphones. This allows us to get the most out of omnidirectional bottle caps like the
        <BlogLink to="#blue-b4-cap" linkType="internal">B4</BlogLink> or figure-eight capsules like the <BlogLink to="#blue-b2-cap" linkType="internal">B2</BlogLink> in 
        stereo recording situations, and to blend the sound of different bottle caps for truly unique captures of performances. Our pair of Blue Bottles are more than 
        conversation pieces - they're unique and critical tools in helping us ensure we deliver the best recording possible for you. 
        <br/>
        Our Blue Bottle microphones and the entire capsule collection are staples and thus available to all clients for any work required. If you'd
        like to try ou a specific bottle cap or combination of bottle caps, just ask! Due to the scarcity of some capsules and cost, our Blue Bottle
        microphones are <i>not</i> available for rental or use outside of Lündhé Audio's facilities.

        I'd wanted a Blue Bottle and the full Bottle Cap set since I was 19. The Bottle had long been a well-reputed microphone, but
        the entry price was too hefty for a college student (and an English major at that). I got lucky in 2024 to come across both a 
        used Blue Bottle with the main nine capsules and the full twelve-capsule line-up, both at arguably bargain prices (about $6k 
        for both mics and all capsules in total). I then set about purchasing extras of the B0-B5 lineup, as they can be more challenging
        to find used.
        <br/>
        To me, the Bottle is going to be one of those microphones that a decade from now is as esteemed as classics like the 
        Neumann U47, Telefunken ELA M 251, etc. Blue was really on to something different with the Bottle, and I always feel a bit sad that
        vintage-fever combined with the runaway success of the Yeti killed whatever momentum Blue's professional line had. I still strongly 
        feel that Blue was at its best when it was following its own, quirky drummer - making strangly shaped but gorgeous sounding microphones
        that truly felt and sounded like one-of-a-kind.
