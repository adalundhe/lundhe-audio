        Part of us wanted to harken back to the younger days of the internet, where small communities and wacky individual sites
        were the norm. Before mass social media, likes, or follows were a glimmer in Mark Zuckerberg's eye. We want to take you
        back to a time where you could find a nice little virtual alcove in the World Wide Web, sit down, pour a cup of coffee or 
        tea, and just enjoy reading someone else's thoughts.

        So welcome on in! Find your perfect proverbial comfy chair, grab your beverage of choice, and enjoy the internet as it
        was meant to be.
